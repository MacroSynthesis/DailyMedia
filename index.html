                            Learning guitar requires a lot of time and effort, in order for you to become a better player
                             and see instant results you need to have consistency, you need to practice as much as possible 
                             in your free time, back when I was a beginner myself I would constantly practice while watching 
                             my favorites shows, after school, even after dying in a game that I was playing, basically what 
                             my point here is that practice in every opportunity you have, even when I was outside in my mind 
                             I would practice in my imagination which I think really gave me a fast result of learning the guitar.

                            Pick a song of your choice that has a basic chord progression such as Huling el bimbo by Eraserheads, 
                            Harana by Parokya ni Edgar, etc, and practice learning at least one song at a time for it will improve 
                            your timing and you’ll be able to master the changing of chords quickly.

                             of the basic skills for playing the guitar but a lot of guitar players have 
                             formed bad habits when that slows their playing, you need to put your fingers
                             arch your fingers and make sure that they are close to the frets so you can avoid
                             the potential of buzzing

                            practicing songs using your ear this is one of the things I wish I could’ve adapted to myself
                             as a beginner guitar player, By learning music by ear, pupils have developed the ability to    
                             anticipate song melodies and identify different musical compositional structures.
